We started Intrinsic to reimagine the learning experience for middle and high school students based on the beliefs that young people learn best when they collaborate, feel a deep sense of belonging, and set and monitor progress toward individualized goals. Our model systematically teaches students to think, solve, communicate and reflect while also building Empathy, Perseverance, Identity and Curiosity - our EPIC Core Values. We flex time and space in both of our schools, redefine the role of teachers, and use technology in new ways to ensure every student receives tailored instruction, and eventually graduates with their own personalized postsecondary plan that is dedicated to their own interests, goals, and choices.Our approach is focused on the whole child, and can look different than in other public schools - in part because of our dual focus on student gains in academics and personal agency. To support this, we use mastery-based grading in many of core content classes; a weekly Choice Day (C Day) for all students; Student-Led Conferences (SLCs) that connect students, teachers, and families three times each year; and Advisory classes comprised of groups of students who meet daily all four years of high school and essentially grow up together, under the guidance of one four-year advisor. Our school culture deliberately prioritizes student voices and relationships - with each other and with adults - while also having very high expectations of them. To support this work, we rely on restorative practices as well as consequences, when necessary, to ensure a safe and joyful learning environment for all students.Intrinsic currently operates two exceptional public high schools open to all Chicago students. Founded in 2013, our Belmont Campus serves 1,000 students in Grades 7-12 in the Hermosa neighborhood. Our Downtown Campus currently serves 625 students in Grades 9-12 and will serve 1,000 students in Fall 2023. Both schools are public schools, with enrollment that is based solely on an open lottery each spring – no tuition, entrance exams or other selective criteria. Our student demographics across both schools are 90% students of color, 86% free and reduced lunch and 19% students with disabilities.*ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY*Intrinsic Schools has been nationally recognized for its innovative use of technology and data by students and staff.
